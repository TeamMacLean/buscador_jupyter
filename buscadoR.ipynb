Hit the little 'play' buttons to make each cell work. You'll need to run each one in turn.\n","\n","The code runs on a computer (here called a 'runtime') in the Google cloud. The runtimes are free but limited. The runtime will be available for 12 hours from the time you start it, after that point the runtime will be erased and you'll need to start again.
